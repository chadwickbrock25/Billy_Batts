An up and coming punk band, Billy Batts & the Made Men, are active on social media, streaming, as well as an existing merch store. They would like to consolidate all of their online activity to a centralized band website. The band manager wanted to have control of adding new merch items to the site at his discretion so an admin link allows him to log into the site to create, delete, or edit. Each item has a show page with a buy button, but currently it only decreases the quantity. In the future the site will accept payments to function as a complete store.

Upcoming events is the landing page for the site where in the future the band's instagram, youtube, & spotify will be presented by a few APIs. CRUD functionality will also be added to the event page for the managerâ€™s customization. The contact page has a form, although the button currently drafts a message to my email, in the future I'll link the input boxes to send the message without having to leave the site. When working with EJS files my CSS has constantly had issues in the public folder so my work around was to style from my partials. I enjoyed the matching header/footer that created visual consistency between the pages

The band was established in 2019, the members' are young & passionate, we hope as the band grows the site can develop.
